By using spatial pyramid pooling layer, rectangular objects can also be recognized, so it can be used for object detection. R-CNN (Reference paper: Contextual Action Recognition with R*CNN)\n","\n","A method for recognizing human actions and object attributes in an image by incorporating not only the localized information of the object itself but also the surrounding information as features, thus taking into account the context and background of the image. Basis in the paper\n","\n","Abstract (2~3)Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck\n","\n","### (2) It says \"Faster\", but what mechanism was used to make it faster?\n","\n","### Solution.\n","\n","Since the time spent on region proposal was the biggest bottleneck in the conventional method, we replaced the method of region proposal by Selective Search with a small convolutional network called RPN (Region Proposal Network), and achieved near real-time calculation speed by performing region proposal and object detection on the RPN.\\ Basis in the paper\n","\n","Introduction:\\ (page1) The latest incarnation, Fast R-CNN [2], achieves near real-time rates using very deep networks [3], when ignoring the time spent on region proposals.\n","\n","### Solution.\n","\n","Object detection methods using neural networks can be classified into One-Stage Detection and Two-Stage Detection, depending on whether the detection is performed in one or two stages. One-Stage Detection performs BoundingBox generation and class prediction in a single step; One-Stage Detection has a simpler structure and is expected to speed up training and inference. One-Stage Detection tends to be inferior to Two-Stage Detection in terms of detection accuracy. In Two-Stage Detection, candidates for BoundingBoxes are extracted in the first stage. In the second stage, class prediction and BoundingBox modification are performed, and the final prediction result is generated. (page10)The Overlap\n","\n","(page10)The OverFeat paper [9] proposes a detection method that uses regressors and classifiers on sliding windows over convolutional feature maps. OverFeat is a one-stage, class-specific detection pipeline, and ours is a two-stage cascade consisting of class-agnostic proposals and class- specific detections. specific detections.

This is a machine learning model that can detect \"where an object appears in an image\" = \"where an object appears and its rectangular shape\".\n","\n","Introduction (page1)The RPN is thus a kind of fully convolutional network (FCN) [7] and can be trained end-to-end specifically for the task of generating detection proposals.\n","\n","### (5) What is RoI pooling?\n","\n","### Solution.\n","RoI Pooling is responsible for making the input to the classification layer a fixed dimension. The feature map corresponding to the region of the object candidate is cut out by RoI Pooling to make feature extraction common and fast. A method to fix the dimensionality even when the image size is different.\\ Basis of the paper\n","\n","(page6) The RoI pooling layer [2] in Fast R-CNN accepts the convolutional features and also the predicted bounding boxes as input, so a theoretically The RoI pooling layer [2] in Fast R-CNN accepts the convolutional features and also the predicted bounding boxes as input, so a theoretically valid backpropagation solver should also involve gradients w.r.t. the box coordinates. These gradients are ignored in the above approximate joint training. In a non-approximate joint training solution, we need an RoI pooling layer that is differentiable w.r.t. the box coordinates.\n","\n","### (6) What is the proper size for Anchor?\n","Solution.\n","Anchors are rectangles that indicate the area of an object, and are generated at regular intervals in the image and used in the Loss Function.
